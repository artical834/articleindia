        <h1>The Story of India’s Independence</h1>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>India's journey to independence is a profound story of struggle, resilience, and the quest for self-determination. It involves a diverse range of leaders, movements, and events that shaped the nation’s path to freedom from British colonial rule.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>The Colonial Era</h2>
            <p>The British East India Company began to establish control over India in the 17th century, and by the 19th century, the British government had formally taken over the administration of India. Under British rule, India experienced significant social, economic, and political changes, many of which led to growing discontent among the Indian populace.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Early Resistance</h2>
            <p>The struggle for independence began with various movements and rebellions. The Sepoy Mutiny of 1857, also known as the First War of Indian Independence, was a significant but ultimately unsuccessful uprising against British rule. Despite its failure, it marked the beginning of organized resistance to British control.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>The Rise of Nationalism</h2>
            <p>In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Indian nationalism began to gain momentum. The Indian National Congress (INC), founded in 1885, became a leading platform for political activism. Leaders like Bal Gangadhar Tilak, Lala Lajpat Rai, and Bipin Chandra Pal played crucial roles in mobilizing public opinion against British rule.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Gandhi’s Leadership</h2>
            <p>Mahatma Gandhi emerged as a central figure in the Indian independence movement. His philosophy of non-violence (Satyagraha) and civil disobedience inspired millions. Key events during his leadership include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>The Non-Cooperation Movement (1920-1922):</strong> A campaign to boycott British goods and institutions.</li>
                <li><strong>The Salt March (1930):</strong> A 240-mile march to the Arabian Sea to protest the British monopoly on salt.</li>
                <li><strong>The Quit India Movement (1942):</strong> A mass protest demanding an end to British rule.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>World War II and Aftermath</h2>
            <p>The impact of World War II weakened British control over India. Post-war, Britain faced immense economic and political pressure to decolonize. The Labour government elected in 1945 was committed to ending British rule in India.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Partition and Independence</h2>
            <p>Amid rising communal tensions, the British decided to partition India into two separate states: India and Pakistan. On August 15, 1947, India gained independence, while Pakistan was created as a separate nation on August 14, 1947. The partition led to widespread violence and the displacement of millions.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>The Legacy</h2>
            <p>India's independence was achieved through the tireless efforts of countless leaders and ordinary people who fought for freedom and justice. The legacy of this struggle is a democratic India, rich in diversity and committed to its principles of freedom and equality.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The story of India’s independence is a testament to the power of collective action, sacrifice, and the relentless pursuit of justice. It continues to inspire nations and individuals around the world in their own struggles for freedom and self-determination.</p>
